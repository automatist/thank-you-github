[Free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), since
the GNU project started in 1985, and in the many surrounding waves of
activity, has been a place for a diversity of practices, programming
styles, opinions, time schedules, personalities and tools. *And that's a
very good thing. This diversity is the core to Free software's strength.
*Social participation *is* often messy and rightly requires an
investment of time and consideration of others.**

Handful of people? Right, standing on the backs of the community that
produced [git](https://git-scm.com/) (for which I feel truly thankful),
the history of alternative [version control
systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software)
and web platforms, not to mention then all the developers whose
contribution to github in the form of entrusting it to manage their code
has made it as valuable a commodity as it is today. *Hegemony, indeed.*
Github represents a [cultural
hegemony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony) in software
development today, and as such is actively displacing and distorting the
practices of the very community that helped to create it.

Social conventions? Like enabling a culture of hostile forking rather
than collaboration? Check out the story of Natacha PortÃ© and [libupskirt
/ libsoldout](http://fossil.instinctive.eu/libsoldout/index) and give
[this thoughtful essay from Aymeric
Mansoux](http://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Fork_Workers.xhtml) a
browse.

And please, may you stop doing it.

As Lily Allen would say, GitHub, fuck you very much.
